# numberGuessingGame

This is a project I did for the Treehouse Python Techdegree. A player must enter numbers 1-10 until they correctly guess the random number. If they guess incorrectly, they are told if their guess is higher or lower than the number they are supposed to guess. Once they have correctly guessed the number, the game will set a new high score if they have beat the previous high score and ask them if they would like to play again.
